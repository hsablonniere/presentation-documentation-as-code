* title "latex" after the first example
* owl picture ?? something else ?
* groundhog picture ?? something else ?
* birds nest pictures ??
* diagram that shows : Markdown => HTML, latex => PDF, Docbook => PDF (only one)
* diagram that shows : Asciidoc to many outputs

* recomanded pratices are often too long for one slide (needs more visuals)
* make the 3 sections stand apart (background)
*

== Something special with this :

* writers write
* push to publish (because docs = code)


== Questions and remarks to Dan

* (first slide) This feels very "bla bla", long sentences and complicated words :
----
Today, I’m going to talk about how you can boost your end-to-end content process, from writing to delivery, by treating documentation as code.
It starts by authoring content in AsciiDoc and transforming it with Asciidoctor.
You’ll then see how this system lets you to tie into existing social coding infrastructure for better collaboration and leverage build tools and pipelines for automated publishing.
What we’re talking about here is reusing tools and process for writing that you’re already using for your software development.
----

* mention a pause after the keep out sign (white screen?)
* Maybe I should tell this story about you to the audience in Lyon/St Etienne

* Maybe this could be better with a white screen
----
I also shared this computer with my siblings.
We all had something to say and each of us wanted our message to be the one published for the world to see.
You know there’s nothing more fierce than sibling competition.
So this was not only my first publishing experience, but also my first collaborative / argumentative one.
----

* alter the split in the notes : "​is to ... separate content and presentation"
* tabs example ?? show the database analogy!
