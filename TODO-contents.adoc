== remarks about dan's slides

* personal story
* relation from story to reality of writing today
** collaborate with others on the creation of that content
** published out in the world is still just as thrilling
** we need a content workflow
** maximum reuse
** facilitates strong collaboration
** flexibility to transform
** publish it wherever it needs to go
* separate content and presentation
* balance
** creation
** publication
** or collaboration
=> asciidoctor fits those needs and we'll evaluate them
start with the writers (content is king)
* evaluate docbook
* evaluate latex
* AsciiDoc => I can finally see my content!
* explain the benefits of the syntax
* roles!!
** pass information to the publisher
* line oriented and left aligned
* no wysiwyg
* ide for writers
* best practices, includes
* publication
* (processor)
* terminology
** asciidoctor vs asciidoc
** separation of content
** => rework what's generated
* nested blocks example
* source of record, not a textual representation of the output
* transformation is the key
* AST
* lorem macro
* many sources (scribed+generated) => many outputs
** Spring REST Docs and swagger2markup
* scott chacon quote
* publication
** build and automated tools
* writers and engineers
* jboss examples
* plain text => history, diffs, rich diffs, branching, merging...
* github
* edit on github (relate to wikipedia)
* know workflows
* keep changes isolated
** tips : one sentence per line
** split files
* use validation
* issue tracker (related PR/commits to issue #)
* separate repositories strategies

== ideas for mine

* démystifier le "la doc c'est chiant"
* mention proselint
* work offline
* add stuffs about the ecosystem
** available in many languages
** atom plugin
** static site generators
** presentations
* montrer une fenêtre de saisie de wordpress ou d'un wiki
* checkbox avec ce que les autres approches apportent
* bouton special pour donner envie de vomir sur docbook
* take away #
* show the diagram with different teams
* show Sarah's quote
* know workflows
** still stuff to try (remember git flow)

* living documentation
** spec, BDD, cucumber
