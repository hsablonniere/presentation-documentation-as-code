<p>What we&#8217;re talking about here is reusing the tools and process for writing that you&#8217;re already using for software development.
But before we get to that, I want to share my earliest memory of publishing and how it relates to challenges in technical writing today.</p>

Anyone old enough to remember that setup?
It was truly a magical machine of entertainment and possibility.</p>

<p>My siblings and I went nuts using The Print Shop to make signs and banners and greeting cards.
As a matter of fact, there were a few years there when I thought Hallmark would go out of business because we were making so many birthday cards ourselves.</p>
</div>
</div>

<section id="print-shop-ref" class="tpl-media source(32,40)"><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/skull.svg" alt="skull"></figure>

<p>My go-to pick among the assortment of fonts, graphics, and borders was definitely the skull and crossbones.
I was told after a few times that, while cool, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best choice for birthday cards.
Whatever.
I&#8217;d just go on to use to make that most important of adolescent items: a sign for my bedroom door that read, &#8220;Keep Out!&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using The Print Shop, of course, involved printing.
Back then, we didn&#8217;t all carry around screens in our pockets, so printing was how we&#8217;d share our creations with the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Printing those signs, banners, and cards was really my first experience publishing content.
What an amazing sense of power it gave me.
I could write and have those words transformed into something material, tangible, and bigger than what was on the screen.
And my words affected other people.
It was such a thrill.</p>

<div class="paragraph cue">
<p>Now, on the practical side of things, printing was <em>not</em> a speedy process.
Once the printer revved up, it would screech and jerk in a flurry of perpetual commotion until the job was complete.
Watching the printer&#8217;s automation was fascinating, but would quickly put you into a trance.
So we&#8217;re talking walk-away-and-come-back-in-an-hour kind of speed.</p>

<p>Besides, the printer ribbons only lasted so long and required a special trip to the store to replace.
So my message&#8212;&#8203;my content&#8212;&#8203;had to be chosen wisely for optimum effect and impact, and to keep my parent&#8217;s grievances about using up the ribbon to a minimum.</p>

<p>I also had to share this computer with my siblings.
And you know there&#8217;s nothing more fierce than sibling competition.
We <em>all</em> had something to say and each of us wanted <em>our</em> message to be the one published for the world to see.
Since each print job would completely tie up the computer, we were forced to work together by circumstance.
So this was not only my first publishing experience, but also my first collaborative / argumentative one.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical content today is not far removed from my childhood print shop.
We still have to choose our words wisely.
We must collaborate with others on the creation of that content.
And, of course, seeing our words published out in the world is still just as thrilling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get there, we need a content workflow that ensures maximum reuse and facilitates strong collaboration while, at the same time, gives us the flexibility to transform that content however we want and to publish it wherever it needs to go automatically&#8212;&#8203;and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>We created AsciiDoc as a writer-centric markup system.
And it shows.
The reaction many writers have when they switch to this syntax is, &#8220;I can finally see my content!&#8221;
That speaks volumes.</p>

<div class="openblock cue">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice about AsciiDoc is that the syntax is clear &amp; concise.
What you see is predominantly content.
It&#8217;s readable in raw form, unlike the other formats we&#8217;ve seen thus far.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paragraphs are just paragraphs, no bullshit.
The remaining marks are based on familiar conventions, such as leading asterisks to itemize a list, asterisks or underscores around a phrase to emphasize it, and leading equal signs to designate a section title.
Keywords that appear in the syntax are based on common terminology such as <code>image</code>, <code>video</code>, and <code>source</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the syntax is remarkably forgiving, which makes it less daunting for first timers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you dig deeper, you&#8217;ll notice a consistency to the syntax.
That&#8217;s because the language is based on repeatable patterns.
Extensions further build on these patterns, which we&#8217;ll get into later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the syntax is extremely semantic.
In fact, AsciiDoc was originally designed as a shorthand for DocBook.
Each bit of content belongs to a node&#8212;&#8203;a content block or phrase.
Nodes can be annotated with extra bits of information that state what the content is, how it might be presented, and other properties.</p>

You don&#8217;t have to worry how much indentation you need and content doesn&#8217;t float out into the ether.
Instead, you rely on delimiter lines, or &#8220;fences&#8221; to encompass the content.
AsciiDoc can then assume everything between those lines is content that belongs to that block.</p>

Consecutive lines that start with an asterisk, for instance, are clearly items in a list.
A line above a block that starts with a period is the block&#8217;s title.
We do the same thing when writing code.
Each statement gets its own line, so there&#8217;s no need for a semicolon to separate statements.</p>

Yeah, I don&#8217;t think so.
WYSIWYG places a barrier between you and your content and robs you of a lot of control.
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s an all too familiar input mechanism in a CMS.
We should really call a CMS a content lobotomy system, or CLS.
Instead of suiting your needs, it <em>seemingly</em> solves your problem by making it impossible to do what you want to do.

<p>Another way to simplify writing with AsciiDoc is to partition large documents.
For instance, you can split up the source of a book along chapter divisions.
You can also import common content or extracted code samples so they don&#8217;t clutter the writer&#8217;s view.
AsciiDoc supports all this through its include mechanism.
You can even include portions of another document by selecting the snippets by line number or tag.</p>

<div class="openblock cue">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bridge to get from content to presentation&#8212;&#8203;you might even say the magic trick&#8212;&#8203;is transformation.
Transformation is the key to being able to publish to a variety of formats and variants of those formats.
Let&#8217;s dive into how transformation works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Asciidoctor reads in the file, it builds an AST, short for abstract syntax tree.
That tree gets passed to a converter, which then transforms the structure into a target format, such as HTML, or some application of HTML, like slides.
This presentation, in fact, is the product of that transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to extend Asciidoctor is to write a custom converter&#8212;&#8203;as was used for this presentation&#8212;&#8203;or tweak one that already exists by supplying custom templates.
The only limit to what output formats you can produce is what you&#8217;re willing and able to create.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even before the tree is sent to the converter, you have a chance to manipulate it using a tree processor.
In fact, you don&#8217;t even have to output anything.
You can just use the AST to query the document for information in a contextual way (unlike grep, which is crude and blind to context).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can go a step further and enhance the parser itself.
Asciidoctor provides an extension API for introducing additional elements into the syntax, such as a custom block or macro.
This is where things gets really exciting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><mark>TODO talk about lorem block macro example</mark></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, you have a lot of control over how the AsciiDoc is interpreted.</p>

<p>Be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that one input document produces one output document.
The integration of multiple sources of content into numerous publishing targets is one of the key strengths of Asciidoctor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you can take one input document that represents a book and produce multiple pages of HTML.
Reasonable enough.
Or, you can use the processor, or a toolchain that wraps it, to weave together input from several sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see this technique used in API documentation tools like Spring REST Docs and swagger2markup, which generate AsciiDoc to document the API methods, then combine that generated content with content written by the author to form a final document (or documents) to be published.
You can also weave in content that gets derived from the source code, such as a configuration property table.
Part generated, part scribed.</p>

<p>AsciiDoc doesn&#8217;t specifically have &#8220;source control support.&#8221;
Instead, it simply lends itself to being source controlled.
No binary blobs, just plain text.

<p>Nothing is a stronger force for inviting participation than an &#8220;Edit on GitHub&#8221; link in your docs.
It presents any page as editable, yet funnels the contributor into a web-based content review workflow based on git.
The web-based editor recognizes AsciiDoc and can show a preview of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside, if you take this route, I strongly recommend investing in git training.
Everyone on the team needs to understand how the git workflow behind the &#8220;Edit on GitHub&#8221; link works to truly benefit from it.
And, trust me, knowing how to use git correctly will save time and toes.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While AsciiDoc is naturally friendly to source control systems, there are some things you can do to optimize collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try to keep changes isolated.
One way to do this is by writing using the sentence-per-line method.
Changes to a sentence do not affect the sentences around it (much like code), and therefore prevents people from step on each other&#8217;s commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also don&#8217;t want documents that are too large, so modularize your content and break up monolithic documents.
People can then work on different parts of the documentation without having to coordinate.
As mentioned earlier, import non-content such as code snippets so it can be managed independently and kept up to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use validation tools to catch writing errors early and drastically cut down on expense micro-migrations to fix these mistakes.
It helps to have a style guide so information is organized consistently without having to do a lot of personal training.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use an issue tracker to manage bugs, improvements, and content initiatives.
You can then see content progress as it moves across the issue board.
Mention the issue when submitting the pull request that resolves it.
Just like code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s best to manage different versions of a document using branches so you can take advantage of the tools the source control system gives you.
To help with this, organize your repositories by software product or logical product group.
Then, have a branch for each major release line.
If different documents have different versioning schemes, or move at different rates, that&#8217;s an indicator you should move them to separate repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of how you structure and organize the content, anyone coming along should be able to build the output through a simple interface, without having to remember complex commands.
This is the role of an automated &#8220;development&#8221; build.
It makes the documentation approachable and allows contributors to verify the changes they make improve the product in the way they expect (and not the opposite).
The documentation can also be staged for review by different groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, AsciiDoc allows you to set up many ways to collaborate, bringing all the voices and talents together in one place to make strong, coherent documentation.</p>
